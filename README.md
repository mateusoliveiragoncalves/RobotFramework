## Documentation:

## First Impressions

1. **Low Code Framework**:
Robot has an accsessible language because of the structure in Settings, Variables, Test Cases and Keywords, that leaves the understanding much more easier.
2. **Library Integration**:
Robot integrates a bunch of libraries in one framework, and it contribute to expand the power of this tool.
Basicaly you will find 3 types of libraries: External (Selenium, Appium, Database for example) , Standard(Built-in Lib for example) and Others.
3. **Readable and Executable**:
Robot has the power of being readable as a Cucumber file, but with one advantage: your readable script will truly execute things in his own body, without another file supporting you business rules, and, if you prefer, you have support to Gherkin as well.
4. **Multi Task**
This tool can be used to 
  * Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
  * Acceptance Tests (ADD)
  * Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
  * Quality Assurance (QA)
  * Database Testing
  * Desktop Automation
  * Other
 5. **CI/CD Support**
 Robot has all the main patterns of other powerfull testing framewotks, offering Logs, Outputs and support to Continuous Integration and Development.
